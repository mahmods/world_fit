            <p>Some people spend years trying to get more muscular, but just can’t seem to make it happen. Whether you want to bulk up, enhance your chest, or achieve any other muscle building goal, here are great tips to build muscle fast:</p>
            <h2>1.	Lifts</h2>
            <p>The only way to significantly increase muscle is to cause muscle fibres to tear, and the only way to do that is to subject the muscles to external forces to which they’re not accustomed.</p>
            <h2>2.	Go Multi-Joint</h2>
            <p>Unless you’re already very muscular, you should use multi-joint exercises like deadlifts, squats, and bench pressing which allows to use much heavier weight than can be lifted with single-joint exercises.</p>
            <h2>3.	Go Heavy</h2>
            <p>This is a better way to build muscle than using a weight that allows you to comfortably complete a set without reaching muscle failure.</p>
            <h2>4.	Avoid Cardio</h2>
            <p>Your body requires calories to build muscle, and if you are doing a significant amount of cardio exercise like running or bicycling, you are burning calories that your body could otherwise be using to build muscle.</p>
            <h2>5.	Eat</h2>
            <p>To put on one pound of muscle, you need to consume at least 3,500 extra calories from healthy protein, fat and carbohydrate sources like grass-fed beef, avocadoes and sweet potatoes respectively.</p>
            <h2>6.	Supplement</h2>
            <p>High quality protein powder and creatine supplement are the best. Other popular muscle-building supplements such as nitric oxide or beta-alanine will achieve small results.</p>
            <h2>7.	Train under an Hour</h2>
            <p>Be sure that you are focusing on keeping the intensity high rather than making the workout drag on. No research says marathon training sessions are better for muscle growth.</p>
            <h2>8.	Focus on Progression</h2>
            <p>If you want to gain weight, you are better off focusing on progressing in either the number of reps or an increase in weight lifted within your main program.</p>
            <h2>9.	Change Rep Range Every 3-4 Weeks</h2>
            <p>Unless you are making great gains and progressing, changing the rep range every 4-6 weeks is suggested to avoid plateaus. Changing the rep range will make your body adapt to the new stress causing you to gain weight in the form of muscle.</p>
