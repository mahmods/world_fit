            <p>There are some universal rules to muscle gain, which can be implemented into personal training regime so as to get strong muscle building results. During the work out journey, there will be a point at which one must divert from the conventional routines and guidelines in order to listen to the body and carve one.</p>
            <h2>The Three Fundamentals of Muscle Gain</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Lifting Heavy Weights: Heavy weights lifting stimulate damage in the muscle fibres, thus forcing the body into responding with muscle growth.</li>
                <li>Eating a Calorie Surplus: To fuel the growth of the new muscle mass, consuming a caloric surplus will be needed to maintain the current bodyweight and to power extra training and muscle growth.</li>
                <li>Rest: Adequate rest is crucial in order to gain muscle mass. In that sense, gaining muscle is as much about what is done outside of the gym as inside.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>The Three Essential Exercise Concepts</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Progressive Overload: Human bodies need a reason to gain muscle. The training efforts must convince the body that getting bigger and stronger is going to present a survival advantage. This is achieved by using heavier and heavier stimulus as time goes on.</li>
                <li>Variance: Our bodies are brilliant at adapting to a training stimulus, so it’s imperative that an element of variance is maintained in the training programs. Variance might constitute anything from manipulating the rep ranges, rest time, exercise selection or training goal altogether.</li>
                <li>Consistency: A consistent approach to training is absolutely essential to developing a muscular physique and seeing results beyond expectations. Success is about doing the right things over and over again.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Here are some of the things you shouldn’t do while training to build your muscle:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not over train yourself as it can lead to fatigue along with symptoms like a raised heartbeat, low mood, muscle aches and poor performance. </li>
                <li>Failing to track your daily workouts should be avoided as it is a way to have an idea of how well there is progress and to avoid over training.</li>
                <li>Training while living an Unhealthy Lifestyle. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Good nutrition and adequate rest is needed. Training while drinking alcohol, smoking, and/or eating less food yield very little results.</p>
